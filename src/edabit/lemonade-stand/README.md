# Lemonade Stand

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by `bills`).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a \$5, \$10, or \$20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays \$5.

Return `true` if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

### Notes

- You don't have any change in hand at first.
- `bills` is an integer array.
- `bills[i]` will be either `5`, `10`, or `20`.
